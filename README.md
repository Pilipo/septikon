Septikon - Uranium Wars
========

Phaser / JS port of the above game

## Dev
* Clone the repo
* npm update and install
* npm start

## Notes
This game is a mess currently. Especially the client side. The server is almost completely functional, but will be in need of major rafactoring efforts. It is safe to say that the client is currently use for little more than testing the server side code.
